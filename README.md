What first started as a dummy first repository has turned into a project!
YAYY!!!
This project would serve as the foundation for the long-sighted project I had in my mind for far too long.
This is a project on collaboration of intelligent swarm robots. The idea is to create a platform where I can connect several bots according to their specification and the main brain would use them to accomplish a complex task like the parts of a system. It's like dismantling your limbs and different organs and control them separately to accomplish something you were not able to before as a whole.
This would specially prove useful in surveillance, servicing, or monitoring purposes. 
The decentralised system might be all the hype but I believe as an engineer I would need an auxilliary support to rectify faults and monitor the bots at the same time.
